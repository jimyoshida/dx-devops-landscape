# Class 200 - Infrastructure and cloud

## Timeline

### 1960s

Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix.
Initial release: 1969

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet.
Etablished: 1969

In computing, "server" dates at least to RFC 5 (1969), one of the earliest documents describing ARPANET (the predecessor of Internet), and is contrasted with "user", distinguishing two types of host: "server-host" and "user-host".

Telnet (short for "teletype network") is a client/server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals of remote systems on local area networks or the Internet.
Telnet was developed as secret technology in 1969 beginning with RFC 15.

### 1970s

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.
Introduction: April 16, 1971

mail is a command-line email client for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
Initial release: November 3, 1971

In 1971 the first ARPANET network mail was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address.
Over a series of RFCs, conventions were refined for sending mail messages over the File Transfer Protocol.

In 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C, contrary to the general notion at the time that an operating system's complexity and sophistication required it to be written in assembly language.

TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.
In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes.
The specification of the resulting protocol (TCP/IP) was written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974.

The cron command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts), also known as cron jobs, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
Initial release: May 1975

The problem of obtaining Byzantine consensus was conceived and formalized by Robert Shostak, who dubbed it the interactive consistency problem. This work was done in 1978 in the context of the NASA-sponsored SIFT project in the Computer Science Lab at SRI International.

A chroot on Unix and Unix-like operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children.
The chroot system call was introduced during development of Version 7 Unix in 1979.

### 1980s

IPv4 is described in RFC 791 (1981).

The Berkeley r-commands are a suite of computer programs designed to enable users of one Unix system to log in or issue commands to another Unix computer via TCP/IP computer network.
Initial release: June 1981

In March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.

The migration of the ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP was officially completed on flag day January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently activated.

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) protocol was implemented on the ARPANET in 1983.

The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system- and user-level application programming interfaces (API).
Started: 1988

### 1990s

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was originally authored in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC.
In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, at the time a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system inspired by UNIX, for a personal computer.
He started with a task switcher in Intel 80386 assembly language and a terminal driver.

On 17 September 1991, Torvalds prepared version 0.01 of Linux and put on the "ftp.funet.fi" â€“ FTP server of the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET). It was not even executable since its code still needed Minix for compilation and play.
On 5 October 1991, Torvalds announced the first "official" version of Linux, version 0.02. At this point, Linux was able to run Bash, GCC, and some other GNU utilities.

Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project. The first version of Debian (0.01) was released on September 15, 1993.

CFEngine is an open-source configuration management system, written by Mark Burgess. Its primary function is to provide automated configuration and maintenance of large-scale computer systems.
The CFEngine project began in 1993 as a way for author Mark Burgess to get his work done by automating the management of a small group of workstations in the Department of Theoretical Physics.
Initial release: 1993

Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running the X Window System. In March 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released with 176,250 lines of code. It was the first version suitable for use in production environments.

Debian first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17, 1996.

Advanced package tool, or APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, and Debian-based Linux distributions. APT Initial release: 31 March 1998
