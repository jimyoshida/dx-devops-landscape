# Class 400 - Security and privacy

## Timeline

### 1970s

The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
The origins of DES date to 1972, when a National Bureau of Standards study of US government computer security identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.
On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard.

Diffie–Hellman key exchange is a mathematical method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key.

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission.
The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.

### 1980s

The Morris worm or Internet worm of November 2, 1988, is one of the oldest computer worms distributed via the Internet, and the first to gain significant mainstream media attention.

X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates.
X.509 First published 1.0 at November 25, 1988

Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed Kerberos in 1988 to protect network services provided by Project Athena.
Kerberos version 4, the first public version, was released on January 24, 1989.

### 1990s

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.

MD5 is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, 1992). When analytic work indicated that MD5's predecessor MD4 was likely to be insecure, Rivest designed MD5 in 1991 as a secure replacement.
First published: April 1992

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest – typically rendered as 40 hexadecimal digits. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.
First published: 1995

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
Netscape developed the original SSL protocols, and Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998, has been described as the "father of SSL".
SSL Version 2.0, after being released in February 1995 was quickly discovered to contain a number of security and usability flaws.

SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and for unsecured remote shell protocols
such as the Berkeley rsh and the related rlogin and rexec protocols.
In 1995, Tatu Ylönen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology, Finland,
designed the first version of the protocol (now called SSH-1)
prompted by a password-sniffing attack at his university network.

Newer versions of SSL/TLS are based on SSL 3.0, released in 1996.

AppArmor ("Application Armor") is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.

Initial release: 1998

OpenSSL is a software library for applications that secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.
