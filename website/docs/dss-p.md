## Advice for Usage

### 1. Identifying Common Skills

Section **01** can be positioned as "Common Literacy" that should be broadly educated regardless of the role to foster an organizational culture for promoting DX.

### 2. Deepening Expertise

- **Software Engineer (SE)**: Focus evaluation on Categories 02, 03, 07, 08, 09, and 10.
- **Data Scientist (DS)**: Focus evaluation on Categories 05, 06, and 07.
- **Business Architect (BA)**: Centered on the Management & Business aspects of Section 01, evaluate understanding of Categories 05 and 06 at a "Utilization/Planning level".
