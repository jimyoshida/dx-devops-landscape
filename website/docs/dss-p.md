## Legend

- **\*\*\* (Must Have)**: Core skills and knowledge areas essential for the role.
- **\*\* (Nice to Have)**: Areas desirable for execution or necessary for collaboration.
- **\* (Partially Relevant / Specialized)**: Relevant in specific contexts/projects or requires basic understanding.
- **-**: Low direct relevance or outside the area of expertise.

## Advice for Usage

### 1. Identifying Common Skills

Section **01** can be positioned as "Common Literacy" that should be broadly educated regardless of the role to foster an organizational culture for promoting DX.

### 2. Deepening Expertise

- **Software Engineer (SE)**: Focus evaluation on Categories 02, 03, 07, 08, 09, and 10.
- **Data Scientist (DS)**: Focus evaluation on Categories 05, 06, and 07.
- **Business Architect (BA)**: Centered on the Management & Business aspects of Section 01, evaluate understanding of Categories 05 and 06 at a "Utilization/Planning level".

## Supplementary Note: About IPA

The **IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan)** is a policy implementation agency under the jurisdiction of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).
It plays a central role in Japan's national IT strategy, including **Human Resource Development** (administering national IT examinations), **Information Security Measures**, and establishing **Guidelines for Digital Transformation (DX)**.

The **"DSS-P (Digital Skills Standard for Promotion)"** referenced in this document is a public standard defined by the IPA to accelerate DX in Japanese companies. It is widely adopted by many Japanese enterprises as a benchmark for talent development and hiring.
