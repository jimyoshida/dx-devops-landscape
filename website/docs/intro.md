# Introduction

In the future system development, detailed tasks are increasingly anticipated to be performed by AI. Consequently, the critical skill will be in the ability to articulate requirements precisely to AI.
This site aims to provide a curated set of well-known keywords, concepts, techniques, and available tools so that DX promoters can make the AI effectively works and create the optimal solutions.

The large domain of knowledge is categorized here using an octal classification system, similar in principle to the [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification).
And the scope is now designed to cover _Common Skills_ of _Digital Skill Standards for DX Promotion (DSS-P)_ created by INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY PROMOTION AGENCY, JAPAN.

## Correspondence with DSS-P

While the DSS provides useful guidelines, frankly speaking, there are problems with its categorization. For example:

* The major category "Technology" is too general; Data Utilization and Security are also supported by technology, making this categorization illogical.

* Software design skills, particularly logic, computational thinking, and object-oriented analysis, are more general skills and are also important for designing business architecture and data infrastructure design.

* Team performance is achieved through individual performance. It would be more reasonable to group them under the umbrella of human skills. It is difficult to understand why Team Building is in the same subcategory as Git. Team building is also general skill for all business activities.

Taking the above into consideration, the classification of this site corresponds to the DSS as follows:

| Class in this site | Category in DSS-P v1.2      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Class 000 - Team and Personal Performance| Personal skills, Technology |
| Class 100 - Programming| Technology |
| Class 200 - System Administartion and SRE| Technology |
| Class 300 - Web and Application| Technology |
| Class 400 - Data Science and Engineering| Data utilization |
| Class 500 - AI, Machine Learning, and LLM| Data utilization |
| Class 600 - Security and Privacy| Security |
| Class 700 - Business Strategy and UX Design| Business transformation |

## Principles

The collections are designed by the following principles:

**Prioritizing Openness:** We favor Open Source Software (OSS) and open formats. This approach minimizes restrictions and vendor lock-in, which can impede agile decision-making. Furthermore, the availability of source code significantly aids in troubleshooting. However, we acknowledge the necessity of certain essential cloud services and include them where appropriate.

**Language Agnosticism:** We regard programming languages primarily as tools. The ease of language conversion today means that multilingual development is a natural outcome. The focus is on selecting the most suitable language for a specific problem domain or cultural context. We treat libraries and commands similarly, valued for the functionality they provide.

**Integrating Human Interaction:** Recognizing that Digital Transformation involves significant organizational and individual change, we incorporate elements from human sciences, such as sociology and psychology. Understanding human behavior is crucial for facilitating successful transformation.

## Contents

**Main** section contains the keywords and concepts.
The keywords include de-facto standards, useful techniques, OSS implementations, etc.

* [PDF Version](pathname:///usr/docs/main.pdf)

**Timelines** section contains major historic events of the selected elements and their predecessors to understand the background histories.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

## Extra

Experimental mind maps are created, but they are hard to read.
