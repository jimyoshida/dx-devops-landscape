# Introduction

In future system development, detailed tasks will increasingly be performed by AI. Consequently, a critical skill will be the ability to articulate requirements precisely to AI using these terms.
This site aims to provide a sophisticated and comprehensive overview of the skill set
which includes well-known concepts, techniques, tools, platforms, and frameworks related to DX and DevOps.

## Contents

Pages in the **Skills** category contain the skill items categorized into 12 classes.
The outline is visualized as a [mind map](pathname:///usr/docs/map.html), too.

Pages in the **Timelines** category contain major historical events related to the curated items.
The descriptions are primarily quoted from the [English version of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other sources are cited.

## PDF Edition

The contents are also available in [PDF format](pathname:///usr/docs/all.pdf).

## Principles

The collections are guided by the following principles:

**Prioritizing Openness:** We favor Open Source Software (OSS) and open formats. This approach minimizes restrictions and vendor lock-in, which can impede agile decision-making. Furthermore, the availability of source code significantly aids in troubleshooting. However, we acknowledge the necessity of certain essential cloud services and include them where appropriate.

**Language Agnosticism:** We regard programming languages primarily as tools. Since developers can now work with multiple languages easily, multilingual development has become a natural standard. The focus is on selecting the most suitable language for a specific problem domain or cultural context. Libraries and commands are treated similarly — valued for the functionality they provide.

**Integrating Human Interaction:** Recognizing that Digital Transformation involves significant organizational and individual change, we incorporate elements from human sciences, such as sociology and psychology. Understanding human behavior is crucial for facilitating successful transformation.
