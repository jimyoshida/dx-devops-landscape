# Intro

_Construction of this site is still on the way..._

In the modern system development landscape, the paradigm is shifting: detailed tasks are increasingly anticipated to be handled by AI. Consequently, the critical skill will be in the ability to articulate requirements precisely and effectively to AI.

To support this, **this site aims to provide a curated set of keywords and concepts—a foundational vocabulary—that DX promoters need to know to communicate with and effectively instruct AI**.

The vast domain of knowledge is categorized here using an octal classification system, similar in principle to the [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification).

## Principles

This site is guided by the following principles:

**Prioritizing Openness:** We favor Open Source Software (OSS) and open formats. This approach minimizes restrictions and vendor lock-in, which can impede agile decision-making. Furthermore, the availability of source code significantly aids in troubleshooting. However, we acknowledge the necessity of certain essential cloud services and include them where appropriate.

**Language Agnosticism:** We regard programming languages primarily as tools. The ease of language conversion today means that multilingual development is a natural outcome. The focus is on selecting the most suitable language for a specific problem domain or cultural context. We treat libraries and commands similarly, valued for the functionality they provide.

**Integrating Human Science:** Recognizing that Digital Transformation (DX) involves significant organizational and individual change, we incorporate elements from human sciences, such as sociology and psychology. Understanding human behavior is crucial for facilitating successful transformation.

Overall, the content curated on this site emphasizes the following key aspects of the digital transformation, devops, and computational thinking:

- **Cultural Shift:** Involves a change in organizational culture to embrace digital tools and methodologies.
- **Agility:** Encourages adaptability and responsiveness to market changes.
- **Customer-Centric:** Focuses on improving customer engagement and experience.
- **Collaboration:** Breaking down silos between teams to enhance communication and teamwork.
- **Automation:** Utilizing tools and processes to automate repetitive tasks, such as testing and deployment.
- **Feedback Loops:** Emphasizes the importance of rapid feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Abstraction:** Focusing on the essential features of a problem while ignoring irrelevant details.
- **Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying trends or similarities in data.
- **Algorithm Design:** Developing step-by-step solutions to problems.

## Contents

**Elements** section contains the keywords and concepts.
The keywords include de-facto standards, useful techniques, OSS implementations, etc.

**Events** section contains major historic events of the selected elements and their predecessors to understand the background histories.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.
