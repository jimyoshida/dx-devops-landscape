# Introduction

_Construction of this site is still on the way..._

In the future system development, detailed tasks are increasingly anticipated to be performed by AI. Consequently, the critical skill will be in the ability to articulate requirements precisely to AI.
This site aims to provide a curated set of well-known keywords, concepts, and available tools so that DX promoters need to know to make the AI effectively works and create the optimal solutions.

The large domain of knowledge is categorized here using an octal classification system, similar in principle to the [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification).

## Principles

The collections are designed by the following principles:

**Prioritizing Openness:** We favor Open Source Software (OSS) and open formats. This approach minimizes restrictions and vendor lock-in, which can impede agile decision-making. Furthermore, the availability of source code significantly aids in troubleshooting. However, we acknowledge the necessity of certain essential cloud services and include them where appropriate.

**Language Agnosticism:** We regard programming languages primarily as tools. The ease of language conversion today means that multilingual development is a natural outcome. The focus is on selecting the most suitable language for a specific problem domain or cultural context. We treat libraries and commands similarly, valued for the functionality they provide.

**Integrating Human Interaction:** Recognizing that Digital Transformation involves significant organizational and individual change, we incorporate elements from human sciences, such as sociology and psychology. Understanding human behavior is crucial for facilitating successful transformation.

## Contents

**Main** section contains the keywords and concepts.
The keywords include de-facto standards, useful techniques, OSS implementations, etc.

**Timelines** section contains major historic events of the selected elements and their predecessors to understand the background histories.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.
