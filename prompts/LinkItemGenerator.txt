For each skill/concept/tool/platform item provided, find the most proper website URL and write the Markdown hyperlink element which label is the site title in English.
The website should be its own project/product home or Wikipedia.
Then, add the description string just after the hyperlink element. The description string should be quoted from the linked site as much as possible. 
The description string should start with "A" or "The". Don't repeat the item name in the description string. Omit the trailing period.
Before printing, classify those items with two level categories.
